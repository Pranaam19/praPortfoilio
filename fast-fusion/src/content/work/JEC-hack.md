Hackathons bring people with technical backgrounds together for problem-solving and developing new ideas. Hackathons can help participants hone their IT skills, meet people and work with others in their field.

Hackathons allow programmers to learn new skills quickly from other professionals. During the timed event, you might experience new coding languages, techniques, industry tools and leadership skills you haven't had access to yet.
